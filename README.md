Takaways: 

I want to say thank you to Nadire Gokcehan and also my main tutor David Pecot for helping me in understanding some of the design elements of the project.

My biggest struggles with the code were not the fundamental usage of the elements in their implementation, but the organization of the elements to be able to help artistically implement the content. This is best displayed with the navigation bar and the sizing of graphical elements since I had many issues in the beginning in getting the graphs to behave the way I wanted.
